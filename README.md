# AnnoyingEx
### Tow Mokaramanee

Simulates an annoying ex. Clicking "here we go again..." will make your ex start thinking about you every 20 minute or so and she will text you. Clicking block will make her forget you forever (or until you click the other button).

**WARNING**
What ever happens do not reply.
